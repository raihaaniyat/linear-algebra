# Linear Algebra Implementations

This repository contains practical implementations of core linear algebra concepts using code.
The goal is to understand linear algebra not just theoretically, but through computation and libraries
commonly used in scientific computing and machine learning.

The project focuses on clarity, correctness, and comparison across different tools.

## Objectives

- Implement fundamental linear algebra concepts programmatically
- Understand how different libraries handle matrix operations
- Bridge theoretical concepts with real-world computation
- Build strong foundations for ML, AI, and numerical methods

This repository prioritizes correctness and conceptual understanding over abstraction.
